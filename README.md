This is small piece of code to demonstrate how 
part-of-speech tags can be used to detect a
particular type of tokens in given text and can be annonymized
using a masking string. In given example here, we are masking
credit card numbers in an email. 


Apart from dependencies, a English corpora also needed to
be installed, using following command: 

	$ python -m spacy.en.download all
